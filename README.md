# Periodic Table Trivia Game!

## Project Description

### Goal
The goal of this trivia game is to assist students in learning and memorizing the first 88 elements of the periodic table by testing their knowledge of each element's atomic number and symbol. This interactive approach aims to make studying chemistry more engaging and effective, reinforcing learning through repetition and active recall.

### Methodology
The game was developed using CodeHS, leveraging multiple functions and nested functions to create an interactive experience. The structure resembles object-oriented programming principles, enabling modularity and reusability. The code was designed to prompt questions, track user responses, and provide feedback to reinforce learning.
